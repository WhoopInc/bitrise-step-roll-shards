  Bitrise step to roll shards
description: |
  Bitrise step to roll shards. The Bitrise [Rolling Builds](https://blog.bitrise.io/post/auto-cancel-builds-and-keep-rolling)
  feature for PRs only rolls builds with the same workflow name and branch. Builds kicked off via the `build-router-start`
  step in a rolled build are however not killed by association. This step kills all shards associated with a build as soon
  as the build is rolled.
